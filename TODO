Lots of things..

* DFA merge needs doing properly, won't follow states where there is a similar match
* maybe separate out DFA transition table building from DFA generation, and/or lazy conversion ?
* grammar and language constructs
* built-in XML parser
* "/etc/" to SYSCONFDIR, nocc.specs.xml.in -> nocc.specs.xml with PREFIX for path-base
