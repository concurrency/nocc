NOCC -- A New occam-pi Compiler
-------------------------------

Installation:

	See the file INSTALL for particulars, but essentially it's:

	./configure
	make

	At the moment, you'll need to have libexpat installed (until
	such time as NOCC gets an alternative/built-in XML parser).


Running:

	The compiler expects to find a "nocc.specs.xml" file, shipped
	with the distribution, searched for in /etc/, /usr/local/etc/,
	the current directory, and finally as ~/.nocc.specs.xml.  A specs
	file may also be specified using the --specs-file option.

	To compile something, more or less:

	nocc foobar.occ

	which, currently, should generate a "foobar.etc" file.  You can't
	do much with this file yet..


Configuration:

	The compiler settings are all contained in the nocc.specs.xml file,
	which doesn't consist of a huge amount currently.  As more options
	appear and become relevant, you'll probably want to modify this
	file.
